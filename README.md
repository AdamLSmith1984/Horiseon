# Horiseon
## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the codebase for Horiseon, a fictional marketing agency. 

#### Acceptance Criteria

* Proper usage of semantic HTML elements
* Logical structure of HTML elements independent of styling and positioning

The client has requested a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

#### Work Completed

* Application's links all function correctly.

  * Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

  * Application's CSS file is properly commented.
